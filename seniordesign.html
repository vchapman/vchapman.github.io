<h2>Implementing OpenPLCS In A CDC</h2>

<h3>Project Statement</h3>
<p>Our task is to explore the OpenPLC project and determine how it can be implemented into a Cyber
Defense Competition (CDC), with the intention of simulating a real-world cyber physical
environment.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), many physical systems are now relying on network
connectivity to provide functionality to users. These systems are often large, and provide an
invaluable service such as power or water management. In addition, they are often undersecured.
By incorporating the OpenPLC project (which simulates the PLC hardware required to control and
monitor these types of systems) into the CDC, we hope to provide the competitionâ€™s contestants
with valuable experience in securing cyber physical systems from malicious actors.</p>
