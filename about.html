<p>
  I am currently a Senior at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering. I am currently looking for full
  time employment as a software developer, in Madison, Wisconsin, upon graduation in May 2018. I am interested in
  automation, testing, and project management. I am interested in automation in that if something can be programmed
  that removes the possibility of human error it should be done to increase the quality of the company. Testing is
  another interest, because with continuous integration and continuous deployment code is being put in front of
  customers at an increased rate, there needs to be a measurement of quality that tests allow.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently a Software Developer in Test at Workiva, where I work on a test automation platform. The platform empowers
  developers to trust their releases. I am also a peer mentor for Iowa State University for the Software Engineering department.
  I work with incoming freshman in the Software Engineering depart become acclimated to Iowa State University and work through
  their first programming courses.
</p>

<p>
  After graduation I plan to move to Madison, Wisconsin. I hope to acquire a position as a Software Engineer, with hopefully
  an emphasis on DevOps or Testing. I have enjoyed my experience developing a test automation system and would enjoy
  developing a automation system, or a build system.
