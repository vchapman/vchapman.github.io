<h2>Implementing OpenPLCS In A CDC</h2>

<h3>Project Statement</h3>
<p>Our task is to explore the OpenPLC project and determine how it can be implemented into a Cyber
Defense Competition (CDC), with the intention of simulating a real-world cyber physical
environment. We have chosen to use Factory I/O to virtualize a real world factory for the teams to secure.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), many physical systems are now relying on network
connectivity to provide functionality to users. These systems are often large, and provide an
invaluable service such as power or water management. In addition, they are often undersecured.
By incorporating the OpenPLC project (which simulates the PLC hardware required to control and
monitor these types of systems) into the CDC, we hope to provide the competitionâ€™s contestants
with valuable experience in securing cyber physical systems from malicious actors.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>
    With my experience as a Software Developer in Test, I took on the role of a Test Engineer for my Senior Design Project.
    I focused primarily on ensuring that throughout the software development phase my team was making wise decisions
    in sustainability, testability, and quality for our project. This included setting up a testing plan, for not only
    unit testing, but also user testing and putting our product in front of the right users to ensure the product was
    tested as it would be used. It also included setting quality guidelines for code formatting and code-reviews.
