<p>
  I graduated from Iowa State University with a Bachelors in Software Engineering. I am currently looking for full
  time employment as a software developer, in Madison, Wisconsin. I am interested in
  automation, testing, and project management. I am interested in automation in that if something can be programmed
  that removes the possibility of human error it should be done to increase the quality of the company. Testing is
  another interest, because with continuous integration and continuous deployment code is being put in front of
  customers at an increased rate, there needs to be a measurement of quality that the automation of tests allow.
</p>

<p>
  I was Software Developer in Test Intern at Workiva, where I worked on a test automation platform. The platform empowers
  developers to trust their releases. I was also a peer mentor for Iowa State University for the Software Engineering department.
  I work with incoming freshman in the Software Engineering depart become acclimated to Iowa State University and work through
  their first programming courses.
